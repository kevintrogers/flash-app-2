		Creating A Set
	</h4>
	<p>
		To create a set, click the create button from the menu. Choose a set name and a description. You can decide 		whether to make it serachable or not. If it is searchable, other users will be able to search for your set and 		   add it to their collection of cards. If you decide to make it searchable, create a set name and description 		    that will make it easier to find for people who are interested in a certain topic. For example:</p>
		<blockquote>
			Name: Periodic table cards<br>
			Description: Learn the elements of the periodic table.
		</blockquote>
	<p>Once you have name and descriped your card set. It is time to add your cards.</p>
	
	<h4>
		Adding Cards
	</h4>
	<p>
		When you add a card to your set, you will need to enter both a key and an answer. The key is the the first 			thing the student will see. The answer is what will be displayed when the card is "flipped." If your key is 		"2+2", the answer should be 4.
